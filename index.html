                </div>
                <p> Hello! My name is Michael Freaney, and I am currently a junior Computer Science
                    student at Texas A&M University,
                    minoring in Game Design and Development. I was born in Manchester, England, and grew up in Houston,
                    Texas, where I
                    currently live. I enjoy music, cooking, and working out in my free time.
                </p>
                <p>I have always held a deep interest in the world of game development, having been
                    around video games since I was a kid, and so I am currently pursuing a career in game programming to make a fulfilling career out of that
                    hobby. By joining Texas Aggie Game Developers (an on-campus chapter of the International Game Developers Association),
                    I've found a chance to explore this interest and get involved with a close-knit community of other game developers,
                    while creating my own projects to hone my problem solving skills (you can find these under "Portfolio"). Opportunities to
                    improve myself, such as working with NetEdgeVR as an intern on training software in virtual reality, have allowed me to step
                    outside of my comfort zone and learn new skills around other hardworking developers. I have also worked with
                    the Texas A&M LIVE Lab as a programmer, where I work with Production, Concept, Design, and Art teams
                    to create research-based educational
                    games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below are links to my resume, Github, and Itch pages, where you can find my work. You can also check out an overview of some of my projects in the navigation bar.

                <p>When I am not in class or studying, I am involved in the Texas A&M Jazz Ensembles,
                    where I play trumpet.
                    Music, specifically jazz, has always been a huge interest and hobby of mine, and I have been
                    learning the bass guitar
                    over the past few months as well. Though it can be difficult to find time to practice during the
                    school semester, I've
                    always made sure I can fit in an hour or two after class to improve my fundamentals. Overall, it has
                    been a great
                    activity to have when I'm not working, so that I can decompress and clear my mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I get the chance, I also spend time learning how to be a better cook. The process of making
                    something from scratch and watching others
                    enjoy it has always been a fun process, and so I try to jump at every chance I have to cook
                    something new for my friends or family.

                <h3>Development Summary</h3>
                <h5>What I worked on</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Finite State Machine AI for stealth-based enemies</li>
                    <li>Shader Graph effects, simple post-processing</li>
                    <li>Optimizing large amounts of visual effects on screen at once</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>What went well</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Workflow was intuitive- the base game was fully made with just 3 levels before I began to make more.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This meant that I could understand the limits of my code and design before creating a challenging set of levels, to avoid overscoping.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>More design-oriented thought process: Less coding and more planning into each system to ensure less errors down the line.</li>
                    <li>Worked to my advantages- my lack of experience in 3D art allowed me to work with that and keep a simplistic style.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>What didn't go as well, lessons learned</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some systems weren't quite as solid/consistent as they could have been - AI in particular had a couple of reworks.
                        <ul>
                            <li>A major roadblock was attempting to integrate sprinting into the list of things that could alert enemies to you. This ultimately made the game too difficult, however, and was scrapped.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Could have had a much more varied field of playtesters to get more perspectives on how the game was playing.</li>
                </ul>

                An infinite 2D action game focused on chaining together exploding potions in a mysterious dungeon.</br></br>
                <h3>Development Summary</h3>
                <h5>What I worked on</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Simple chemistry system design
                        <ul>
                            <li>Potion reactions between enemies and player-placed potions</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                    </li>
                    <li>File parsing system for maximum development efficiency
                        <ul>
                            <li>Potions and their crafting recipes were entered into a CSV.</li>
                            <li>This way all we had to do is program the effects in.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                    </li>
                    <li>First game ever seen to completion.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>What went well</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learnt about the structure of Unity and C#, as well as the basics of threading and vector spaces.</li>
                    <li>Team dynamic was helpful, with frequent idea sessions to improve the backend systems of our game.</li>
                    <li>Managed to fit in some stretch goals, such as a level editor with online sharing capabilities.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>What didn't go as well, lessons learned</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Code was a little messy sometimes, likely because of how new the team was to Unity/C#.</li>
                    <li>Had some issues getting on the same page in terms of design- better communication would have fixed that.</li>
                    <li>Dove into coding way too quickly, with not much thought towards properly planning the product out.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Development Summary</h3>
                <h5>What I worked on</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cooking system game logic, along with a request ticket system that works on an infinite difficulty progression.</li>
                    <li>Optimization of assets for the sake of lag reduction</li>
                    <li>Cooperating with an artist on a severe time crunch</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>What went well</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Game logic came out really nice, despite some (now cleaned up) spaghetti code.</li>
                    <li>Having a completed product for my first 48 hour game jam.</li>
                    <li>Spent a nontrivial amount of time on design, incorporating the theme into the game loop.
                        <ul>
                            <li>The player's goal is to maintain control of the truck and the orders.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h5>What didn't go as well, lessons learned</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Even with a simple gameplay loop, likely overscoped.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Should try to do 2D for 48 hour jams in future.</li>
                            <li>Request system was a little too complex- had much less time to debug than needed.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Could have established better workflow with artists to prevent any panics.</li>
                    <li>Thirty more minutes of planning could have saved hours of bug fixing.</li>
                </ul>
